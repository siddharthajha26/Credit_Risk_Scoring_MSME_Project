    "Decision trees are widely used machine learning algorithms and can be applied to both classification and regression tasks. They work by splitting data based on feature values, forming a tree-like structure where each leaf node gives a prediction. Their simplicity and easy interpretation make them widely used in many applications.\n",

    "It works by greedily choosing the feature that maximizes the information gain at each node. It calculates entropy and information gain for each feature and selects the feature with the highest information gain for splitting.\n",
    "- Entropy: It measures impurity in the dataset. Denoted by H(D) for dataset D is calculated using the formula :$H(S) = \\Sigma_{i=1}^{n} -p_i \\log_2(p_i)$ where S is the current set of samples,$p_i$ is the probability of the $i_{th}$ class in the dataset D\n",

After the tree is constructed it prune branches that don't significantly improve accuracy to reduce overfitting. But it tends to overfit the training data and cannot directly handle continuous attributes. These issues are addressed by other algorithms like C4.5 and CART"

It automatically selects and positions these knots based on the data distribution and the need to capture non-linearities.\n",

    "\n",
    "In gradient boosting decision trees, we combine many weak learners to come up with one strong learner. The weak learners here are the individual decision trees. All the trees are conncted in series and each tree tries to minimise the error of the previous tree. Due to this sequential connection, boosting algorithms are usually slow to learn, but also highly accurate.In statistical learning, models that learn slowly perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weak learners are fit in such a way that each new learner fits into the residuals of the previous step so as the model improves. The final model aggregates the result of each step and thus a strong learner is achieved. A loss function is used to detect the residuals. For instance, mean squared error (MSE) can be used for a regression task and logarithmic loss (log loss) can be used for classification tasks. It is worth noting that existing trees in the model do not change when a new tree is added. The added decision tree fits the residuals from the current model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning rate and n_estimators (Hyperparameters)- Careful Tunning is required to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning rate- denoted as α, simply means how fast the model learns. Each tree added modifies the overall model. The magnitude of the modification is controlled by learning rate. The lower the learning rate, the slower the model learns. The advantage of slower learning rate is that the model becomes more robust and efficient. In statistical learning, models that learn slowly perform better. However, learning slowly comes at a cost. It takes more time to train the model\n",
    "\n",
    "n_estimator is the number of trees used in the model. If the learning rate is low, we need more trees to train the model. However, we need to be very careful at selecting the number of trees. It creates a high risk of overfitting to use too many trees."

    "In tree-based models like XGBClassifier, true \"coefficients\" (slopes) do not exist as they do in linear regression. Instead, the standard metric for feature importance is used to quantify the contribution of each feature. \n",

    "In XGBoost, importance_type determines how the relative \"value\" or importance of each feature is calculated. There are three primary metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Weight (Frequency): The number of times a feature is used to split the data across all trees in the ensemble.\n",
    "It tells  how often a feature was chosen as a decision point.\n",
    "Risk: It can be biased toward high-cardinality features (numerical variables with many unique values) because they naturally provide more potential split points compared to binary or categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Gain (Average Loss Reduction:  The average reduction in training loss (improvement in accuracy) brought by a feature each time it is used for a split.It tells the actual predictive contribution of a feature. Higher gain means the feature was more effective at reducing error.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cover: The average number of samples (training instances) affected by splits that use a specific feature. it tells how responsible is for large portions of the dataset.A high coverage means that a features is categorising lare samples of data at once.A low Coverage means that the sample size of the feature that covers the dataset in training instance is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Total Metrics: Cumulative versions—total_gain and total_cover—are also available, which sum these values across all trees rather than averaging them."
